# Supabase Client Deep Dive: Initialization & Usage in Next.js

This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding how Supabase client instances are initialized and utilized within this Next.js project, particularly focusing on the differences between client-side and server-side contexts, the role of middleware, and the interaction with Server Actions.

## Core Concepts

1.  **Environment Variables:** Supabase requires two key environment variables:
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase project's anonymous (public) key.
    These are typically stored in an `.env.local` file and are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be accessible on the client-side as well.

2.  **`@supabase/ssr` Package:** This package is specifically designed for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) frameworks like Next.js. It helps manage user sessions by handling cookies securely on the server.

3.  **Client Types:**
    *   **Browser Client:** Used in Client Components (`'use client'`) for direct interactions from the user's browser.
    *   **Server Client:** Used in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions (`'use server'`) for operations that need to occur on the server, often involving cookie management for sessions.

## Supabase Client Initialization Files

*   **Location:** `/src/lib/supabase/`
*   **Responsibility:** To provide standardized functions for creating Supabase client instances tailored for either client-side or server-side use.

### 1. `/src/lib/supabase/client.ts`

*   **Purpose:** To create a Supabase client instance intended for use in the **browser (Client Components)**.
*   **Code:**
    ```typescript
    import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr';

    export function createClient() {
      return createBrowserClient(
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
      );
    }
    ```
*   **Explanation:**
    *   Uses `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr`. This function is optimized for client-side environments.
    *   It directly accesses environment variables because it runs in the browser where `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are available.
    *   This client does not handle cookie storage/retrieval itself; that's managed by Supabase's JS library interacting with the browser's cookie store.
*   **When to Use:** Import and call `createClient()` from this file in any Client Component (`'use client'`) that needs to interact with Supabase (e.g., fetching user-specific data for UI, client-side mutations not handled by Server Actions).
    ```typescript
    // Example in a Client Component
    'use client';
    import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client';
    import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    function UserProfile() {
      const supabase = createClient();
      const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        const fetchUser = async () => {
          const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
          // @ts-ignore
          setUser(user);
        };
        fetchUser();
      }, [supabase]);
      // ... render UI ...
    }
    ```

### 2. `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`

*   **Purpose:** To create a Supabase client instance intended for use on the **server (Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions)**. This client is crucial for managing authentication sessions via cookies.
*   **Code:**
    ```typescript
    "use server"; // Ensures this module and its functions are server-only

    import { createServerClient, type CookieOptions } from '@supabase/ssr';
    import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

    export async function createClient() { // Note: async function
      const cookieStore = await cookies(); // Access cookies using Next.js's server-only 'cookies()'

      return createServerClient(
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
        {
          cookies: {
            getAll() {
              return cookieStore.getAll();
            },
            setAll(cookiesToSet) {
              try {
                cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>
                  cookieStore.set(name, value, options)
                );
              } catch {
                // The `setAll` method was called from a Server Component.
                // This can be ignored if you have middleware refreshing
                // user sessions.
              }
            },
          },
        }
      );
    }
    ```
*   **Explanation:**
    *   **`"use server";`**: This directive at the top of the file is critical. It marks the entire module as server-only. This ensures that code within this file, especially `cookies()` from `next/headers`, is only ever executed on the server.
    *   Uses `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr`.
    *   **`async function createClient()`**: The function is `async` because `cookies()` (which provides access to the request's cookies) must be `await`ed. This means any code calling this `createClient` function must also `await` it.
    *   **Cookie Management:** The `cookies` option passed to `createServerClient` is vital. It tells the Supabase client how to read and write cookies using Next.js's server-side cookie store.
        *   `getAll()`: Reads all cookies from the incoming request.
        *   `setAll()`: Sets cookies on the outgoing response. The `try...catch` block handles cases where `setAll` might be called in a context where response headers can't be set directly (like during the render of a Server Component), relying on middleware to handle session refreshes.
*   **When to Use:**
    *   **Server Actions (e.g., in `src/features/auth/mutations/auth.mutations.ts`):**
        ```typescript
        'use server';
        import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';
        // ... other imports

        export async function signInWithPassword(prevState: any, formData: FormData) {
          const supabase = await createClient(); // MUST await
          // ... logic using supabase.auth ...
        }
        ```
    *   **Route Handlers (e.g., `src/app/(auth)/auth/confirm/route.ts`):**
        ```typescript
        import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';
        import { type NextRequest } from 'next/server';
        // ...

        export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
          const supabase = await createClient(); // MUST await
          // ... logic using supabase.auth ...
        }
        ```
    *   **Server Components (for data fetching directly in the component):**
        ```typescript
        import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';

        export default async function MyServerComponent() {
          const supabase = await createClient();
          const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
          // ... render UI based on user ...
        }
        ```

## The Role of Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)

*   **Purpose:** Middleware runs on the server before a request is processed for matching paths. In this project, it's primarily used for **session management**.
*   **Code Snippet (relevant part):**
    ```typescript
    import { createServerClient, type CookieOptions } from '@supabase/ssr';
    import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from 'next/server';

    export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
      let response = NextResponse.next({ /* ... */ });

      const supabase = createServerClient(
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
        {
          cookies: {
            get(name: string) { return request.cookies.get(name)?.value; },
            set(name: string, value: string, options: CookieOptions) {
              request.cookies.set({ name, value, ...options });
              response = NextResponse.next({ request: { headers: request.headers } });
              response.cookies.set({ name, value, ...options });
            },
            remove(name: string, options: CookieOptions) { /* ... */ }
          },
        }
      );

      // Refresh session if expired - important for maintaining user login state.
      await supabase.auth.getSession();

      return response;
    }
    ```
*   **Explanation:**
    *   It creates a Supabase server client instance similarly to `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`, configuring cookie handling based on the incoming `request` and the outgoing `response`.
    *   **`await supabase.auth.getSession()`**: This is the most critical line for auth. It attempts to get the current session. If the access token is expired but a valid refresh token exists, Supabase will automatically refresh the session and update the cookies. The `set` function within the `cookies` config ensures these new session cookies are attached to the `response`.
    *   This ensures that subsequent Server Components, Route Handlers, or Server Actions in the same request lifecycle receive the most up-to-date session information.

## Why the Separation and Directives?

1.  **Security:** Server Actions (`'use server'`) and server-side `createClient` prevent exposing sensitive operations or keys to the browser. Cookie handling must happen on the server to be secure.
2.  **Next.js Architecture:**
    *   **`'use client'`**: Required for components that use React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) or browser-specific APIs. The Supabase browser client is suitable here.
    *   **`'use server'`**:
        *   For Server Actions: Marks functions that execute exclusively on the server, callable from client components. These actions need the server client to interact with Supabase and manage sessions.
        *   For modules like `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`: If a module uses server-only APIs like `cookies()` from `next/headers`, it *must* be marked with `'use server';` or be imported *only* by other server-only modules/components. This prevents accidental bundling of server code into client JavaScript.
3.  **Session Integrity:** The `createServerClient` (from `@supabase/ssr`) coupled with the middleware ensures that user sessions are correctly maintained and refreshed across server-rendered pages and API interactions. Without this server-side cookie management, the user would quickly appear logged out.

## Import Strategy: Direct Imports vs. Barrel Files

*   **Client-side (`/src/lib/supabase/client.ts`):** Can be exported via a barrel file (`/src/lib/supabase/index.ts`) if desired, as it doesn't contain server-only dependencies. However, for maximum clarity, direct imports like `import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client';` are also perfectly fine and often preferred.
*   **Server-side (`/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`):**
    *   **Crucial:** Because this file itself uses `cookies()` from `next/headers` (and is marked `'use server'`), it should **always be imported directly** by other server-only modules (Server Actions, Route Handlers, Server Components).
    *   `import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';`
    *   Avoid exporting `createClient` from `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` through a general barrel file (`index.ts`) that is also used by client components. This can confuse the Next.js build process and lead to errors about server-only code being in client bundles.

## Common Pitfalls for Junior Developers:

1.  **Forgetting `await`:**
    *   When calling `createClient()` from `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (because it's `async`).
    *   When calling any `async` Supabase method (e.g., `await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword(...)`).
2.  **Using the Wrong Client:**
    *   Trying to use `createClient` from `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` in a Client Component.
    *   Trying to use `createClient` from `/src/lib/supabase/client.ts` in a Server Action where session/cookie management is needed.
3.  **`'use server'` Misplacement:**
    *   Adding `'use server'` to files that don't export async functions (like Zod schema files).
    *   Forgetting `'use server'` in files containing Server Actions or files that use `next/headers` (like `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`).
4.  **Middleware Configuration:** Not understanding that the middleware is essential for keeping sessions alive.
5.  **Import Paths:** Confusion about direct imports vs. barrel files, especially for the server client. **Rule of thumb: server-only code should directly import the server client.**

By understanding these distinctions and following the patterns in this project, developers can confidently work with Supabase authentication in a Next.js App Router environment.
