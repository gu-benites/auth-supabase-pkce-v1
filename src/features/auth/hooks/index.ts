// This file is for custom React hooks related to authentication features.
// For example, you might have hooks for managing client-side auth state or user profiles.
// Currently, this project uses built-in React hooks (useState, useEffect, useActionState, useFormStatus)
// and custom general-purpose hooks from /src/hooks (e.g., useToast).
// If specific auth-related client-side logic needs to be encapsulated into a reusable hook,
// it would be defined here.
