// src/features/chat/components/index.ts
// Exports for ChatPage, ChatInput, and ChatMessages have been removed
// as their functionality is now handled by components within src/features/dashboard/chat/
// or are superseded.

// If there are other genuinely reusable components in this directory unrelated to the main chat UI,
// their exports should remain. For now, assuming this file becomes empty or is a candidate for deletion
// if no other components were present.
