# Implementation Summary for Jules

This document catalogs the steps taken to refactor the authentication and state management of the PassForge application, based on the plan in `docs/implementation-consultant.md`.

## Phase 1: Refactor Core Auth State Management (useAuth Hook)

**Task 1.1: Create `AuthSessionProvider` (React Context)**
*   Created `src/components/providers/auth-session-provider.tsx`.
*   Implemented as a Client Component (`'use client'`).
*   Uses Supabase browser client and `onAuthStateChange` listener.
*   Provides raw Supabase `User` object, `isLoading` state, and `error` state via React Context.

**Task 1.2: Update Root Layout**
*   Modified `src/app/layout.tsx`.
*   Removed the existing Zustand-based `AuthStateProvider`.
*   Wrapped the application with the new `AuthSessionProvider`.

**Task 1.3: Create Service and Query for User Profile**
*   Created `src/features/profile/schemas/profile.schema.ts` defining `UserProfileSchema` and `UserProfile` type (with fields like id, email, firstName, lastName, role, subscription details, etc.).
*   Created `src/features/profile/services/profile.service.ts` with `getProfileByUserId` function to fetch and merge profile data from a `profiles` table and `auth.users`. This is a server-side service.
*   Created `src/features/profile/queries/profile.queries.ts` with `getCurrentUserProfile` Server Action that calls `getProfileByUserId`.

**Task 1.4: Create `useUserProfileQuery` Hook**
*   Created `src/features/profile/hooks/use-user-profile-query.ts`.
*   Implemented as a client-side hook using TanStack Query's `useQuery`.
*   `queryKey`: `['userProfile', userId]`.
*   `queryFn`: `getCurrentUserProfile` Server Action.
*   Handles `enabled` state based on user authentication.
*   Created `src/features/profile/hooks/index.ts` to export the hook.

**Task 1.5: Create the New `useAuth` Hook**
*   Created `src/features/auth/hooks/use-auth.ts`.
*   Implemented as a client-side hook.
*   Consumes `AuthSessionContext` (via `useAuthSession`) for raw `user`, session `isLoading`, and `sessionError`.
*   Calls `useUserProfileQuery` for `profile` data.
*   Combines states: `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `user`, `profile`, `error`.
*   Updated `src/features/auth/hooks/index.ts` to export the new `useAuth`.

**Task 1.6: Refactor Zustand Store (`useAuthStore`)**
*   Modified `src/stores/auth.store.ts`.
*   Removed auth-related state (`user`, `profile`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `error`).
*   Removed auth-related actions (`setUserOnly`, `fetchUserProfile`, `clearAuth`, `setLoading`, `setError`, `initializeAuthListener`).
*   Removed the old `useAuth` hook from this file.
*   The store is now a minimal placeholder for potential future non-auth global client-side state.

**Task 1.7: Update Components Using Auth State (In Progress at time of submission)**
*   Read `src/features/homepage/components/header.tsx` to understand its current auth state usage.
*   The next step was to update this component to use the new `useAuth` hook. This task was interrupted by new user feedback and the end of the session.
